# News Scrapper
## Purpose
Instead of copy/paste, download, print to pdf etc, you can **save online newspaper articles** by following these steps:
1. Copy the article URL
2. Paste it in the application and click 'Scrape it'
3. You'll get a form with fields (author, title, published date etc.) already populated
4. Check and save the article
*(It works only for [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/))*
